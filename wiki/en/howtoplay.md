# How to play

## First magic selection

The most important tool for the progression of any magic in this mod is your advancement menu. As you might have seen while spawning in a new world, you obtained the advancements section called Elemental Convergence. To select your first magic, type /magic ***index***. The index is the number between brackets () next to each "magic selected" advancements. If you are curious about each's magic information, feel free to read the wiki page called magics.md.
## Leveling up
Once you have your magic selected, you just need to find the requested item to gain access to that level (and thus, ability).
**IMPORTANT:** You can only level up a certain magic by having that magic selected. E.g. You cannot level up water while being fire.
## Changing Magics
To change magics, you will need to craft and place the altar of convergence. Once this is placed, you will need to craft the specific eye you need to change magic and use it on the altar of convergence. E.g. I want to become water: I need to craft the eye of watery magic and right click with it in my hand on the altar of convergence.
You DO NOT lose any progression for other magics when swapping. You also cannot gain any levels at that same time and cannot use any of their abilities.

**IMPORTANT:** Every single recipe for the items in this mod is given when you die for the first time.
**TIP:** Just type "eye" in the recipe book to see all the possible magics in a glance.
## Convergences
Convergences are strong and powerful magics that can only be selected by having maxed its two component (base) magics. They do not inherit the abilities or passives of its component magics. To know more about the possible convergences, you can read the wiki page called convergences.md. To craft these convergence eyes. you will need to find how to craft the convergent eye. Small advice, this is somewhat math related, and you can also base yourself on the form of the bounding sequence to know which type of crafting table to use.
**IMPORTANT:** You need to have every component magic level 3 to be able to select the convergence magic.
