# Base Magics
Each magic in Elemental Convergence follows the same template:

- A Passive Buff
- A Passive Debuff
- Level 1 Ability
- Level 2 Ability (Movement Based)
- Level 3 Ability

Players start their specific magic progression level 0 with only access to the buff and debuff. Players must obtain specific items while being that specific magic to progress and level up. You can see which items you need to level up by going in the Elemental Convergence advancement tab. Each level gives access to a new different ability with various ability. Important note: No matter the magic, level 2 is always a movement ability.

The following magics' descriptions contain the magic's index (the number you need to type after /magic [index] to select it).  They also contain an impact rating, which represents how much this magic impacts the normal vanilla Minecraft gameplay. Finally, the "Playstyle" field is what archetype this magic somewhat focuses on. Every magic is well-rounded by having utility and combat abilities. Yet, some are better at doing certain things than others.

**WARNING:** You only have access to that a specific magic's ability if its the one you have currently selected.

**IMPORTANT:** Every magic level is saved independently. E.g. Water Level 3 and Fire Level 3 are two different things. Progression is also saved when swapping.
