# Elemental Convergence
## Description
Elemental Convergence is a mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 using Fabric made by Charles-Étienen Fréchette (elroxx). This mod implements elemental magic classes that you can play as. Each magic has their own passive abilities, and unlockable active abilities by obtaining specific items and leveling up. These magics, once maxed out, can be merged with other magics into a convergence magic, which plays as a third magic.
## Features
### Base Magics:
- Earth
- Air
- Fire
- Water
- Shadow
- Light
- Life
- Death
### Convergence Magics
- Plague (Death/Life)
- Gravity (Earth/Shadow)
- Steam (Water/Fire)
- Holy (Air/Light)
- Honey (Life/Air)
- Blood (Shadow/Death)
- Quantum (Light/Water)
- Mystic (Fire/Earth)

## Future development goals
Short term: add a third wave of full convergences so that every base magics has access to 3 magics.
Long term: Every combo of 2 base magics has a convergence. Some magics may not respect the full template of my base magics.
